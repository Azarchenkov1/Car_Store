# Car_Store

Repository can have code, that not belong to me(exeption is examples/application), so Im sory for that,
just dont know how rightly configure github project yet.

Simple website using Rocket framework and native JavaScript
No database, data saving as json.
No authorization yet.

For run write cargo run and open localhost:8000/store.html
